# 👋 Hi, I’m Hitesh Reddy

🚀 I'm a passionate **Software Engineer & AI Developer** pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at the **New Jersey Institute of Technology** (GPA: 4.0/4.0). I specialize in building intelligent, scalable systems that bridge the gap between software and data.

---

## 👨‍💻 What I Do

- 🧠 **AI & LLM Engineering**: I develop intelligent agents using LangGraph, LangChain, and HuggingFace models. I focus on optimizing model behavior, reducing hallucination, and evaluating outputs through rigorous metrics.
- 🔧 **Full-Stack Development**: From frontend interfaces with React.js to backend APIs using FastAPI, Django, or Node.js—I'm comfortable across the entire stack.
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Cloud**: I containerize and deploy scalable services using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS)**.
- 📊 **Machine Learning**: I design ML pipelines and build robust models with **PyTorch**, **Scikit-learn**, and **TensorFlow**, focused on NLP and time series forecasting.
